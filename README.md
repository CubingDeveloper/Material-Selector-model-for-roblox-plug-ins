# Material Selector module for roblox plug-ins
## Set-up
You can find the plugin here: [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/93888406964695/MaterialSelector-module-for-plugins).
Once you have installed it in Roblox Studio go to your toolbox then those four squares, I know great description, then my models. And then it should be there! Simply click it to insert it!

## Usage
Require the module script and initialize it like this:
```lua
local MaterialSelectorModule = require(script.MaterialSelectorModule)
MaterialSelectorModule.init(plugin) --The plugin is for creating UI. This is required.
```
Then bind the open to a function
```lua
MaterialSelector.onMaterialSelectionStarted = function()

  local selectedMaterial: Enum.Material = MaterialSelectedEvent.Event:Wait()
  if selectedMaterial then
    print("User selected material", selectedMaterial)
  else
    print("User cancelled the interaction")
  end
end
```
And now... for the final part, open the UI!
```lua
MaterialSelectorModule.promptSelectMaterial()
```
And now the user will be prompted to select a material! If you want to edit the preview colours simply use the function `.ColorUpdate(Color3)` to change all of the colours to a Color3
